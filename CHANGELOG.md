# 1.10.3

* Added support for Kotlin 1.4
* Fixed [#315](https://github.com/mockk/mockk/issues/315) - Allow to combine @Spyk with @InjectMocks
* Fixed [#510](https://github.com/mockk/mockk/issues/510) - Matching of functions with two arguments of type List fails
* Fixed [#352](https://github.com/mockk/mockk/issues/352) by adding a clarification when using slots to capture the same function more than once, to suggest using a mutableList.
