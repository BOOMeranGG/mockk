# 1.10.3

* Added support for Kotlin 1.4
* Fixed #315 - Allow to combine @Spyk with @InjectMocks
* Fixed #510 - Matching of functions with two arguments of type List fails
* Fixed #352 by adding a clarification when using slots to capture the same function more than once, to suggest using a mutableList.
